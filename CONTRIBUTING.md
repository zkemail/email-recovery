## 1. Code of Conduct

We will not discriminate against people on any grounds other than their code contributions, and make clear that behaviour that would be harmful to other people that may wish to contribute is not acceptable. This gives clear authority to remove people who are causing problems, and also sets a clear tone of inclusion.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our Code of Conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our community strives to:

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
- **Be kind to others**: Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the community team at [paradox@pse.dev](mailto:paradox@pse.dev).

1. **Remarks that violate the Relayer Utils standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed.** (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. **Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.**
3. **Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.**
4. **If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., temporarily banned from the community.**
5. **If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned permanently from the community.**
6. **Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.**
7. **If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in a private discussion.**

**Please try to emulate these behaviors, especially when debating the merits of different options.**

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
