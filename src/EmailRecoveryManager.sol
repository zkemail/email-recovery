/**
 * @title EmailRecoveryManager
 * @notice Provides a mechanism for account recovery using email guardians
 * @dev The underlying EmailAccountRecovery contract provides some base logic for deploying
 * guardian contracts and handling email verification.
 *
 * This contract defines an implementation for email-based recovery. It is designed to
 * provide the core logic for email-based account recovery that can be used across different
 * account implementations. The core logic is agnostic to the account implementation and could be
 * implemented as part of a smart account module, or on a smart account itself.
 *
 * EmailRecoveryManager defines "what a valid recovery attempt is for an account", and leaves
 * defining "how that recovery attempt is executed on the account" to contracts implementing
 * EmailRecoveryManager. A specific email command handler is also accociated with a recovery
 * manager. A command handler defines and validates the recovery email commands. Developers can
 * write their own command handlers to make specifc commands
